# Cut the Rope Cross Platform Decompilation

This is a better version of the Cut the Rope Decompilation which can be found on [Cut the Rope Home](https://ctrhome.github.io) (specifically the original unpatched version on the Discord server) that has been freed from the clutches of WinForms for future modding.



### Compiles on:

* Windows — Windows and Linux, via Visual Studio or build\_windows.bat.
* Linux — Windows (probably works) and Linux, via build\_linux.sh.



## To-do

* Make the UI for slim vertical resolutions scale to be smaller when the scaled game view is smaller than expected.
* Add(?)/fix horizontal scrolling.
* Add/enable(?) background looping.
* Implement PL\_MPEG as a video player. This is the last requirement for starting the game from a new save.
* Add touchscreen support.



## Future Plans

* A cleaner and maybe reorganized codebase.
* New sprite system.
* Dynamic box system, with music and graphics options.
* Windows Phone 7 and Experiments (Windows Phone 7) objects.
* A bunch of easily changeable custom settings for mods. (PC or Mobile physics, menu layout stuff, trajectory detection for socks/hats, etc.)
* New built-in boxes: Original (1-14 from Windows Phone 7), Experiments (1-6 from Windows Phone 7), Special (Pinned Box from CtR IE9, Holiday Gift)



## Notes

To keep OpenAL happy, make sure your sound effects are stereo.
